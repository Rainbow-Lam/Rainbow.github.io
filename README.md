### How the effect of self-esteem on relationship satisfaction differs between gender?
**Objectives:**
- The sociometer theory suggests that self-esteem does not only reflect a person's perceived self-worth, but also helps individuals to estimate their social acceptance within their relationships 
- Women are more sensitive to social acceptance cues, which makes them more easily infleunced by self-esteem in personal relationship
- Based on the sociometer theory, it is hypothesized that women will be more affected by self-esteem in their ratings for relationship satisfaction 
- The study aim to explore the interaction between self-esteem and gender in predicting relationship satisfaciton

**Approach:**
- The data is collected from an open-source dataset from *PlosOne* by Wang (2015)
- A total of 104 Chinese college students were recruited, and they completed surveys assessing self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, power, and authenticity (i.e. how consistently one behave according to their true desires while interacting with others)

**Findings:**
- I tested how self-esteem and gender predicts relationship satisfaction by using multiple regression
- There is no gender differnece in how self-esteem predicts relationship satisfaction, which is agains the original hypothesis
- This shows that women are not more affected by self-esteem in personal reltionahips

- For exploratory purpose, I also explore the effect of self-esteem on relationship satsifaction when controlling for power and authenticity by using a multiple regression
- The results shows that self-esteem can explain unique variances in the relatinoship satisfaction, showing that it is a storng predictor of relationship satisfaction

**Implications**
- The result contradicts with the original hypothesis, which shows that gender does not affect self-esteem
- Since all the participants in this study is Chinese, this might suggest that the sociometer theory is less applicable in non-western samples
- This results calls for future research testing the sociometer theory in different cultural contexts and bigger sample sizes
