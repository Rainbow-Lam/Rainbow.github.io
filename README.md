### How the effect of self-esteem on relationship satisfaction differs between gender?
**Objectives:**
- The sociometer theory suggests that self-esteem does not only reflect a person's perceived self-worth, but also helps individuals to estimate their social acceptance within their relationships 
- Women are more sensitive to social acceptance cues, which makes them more easily infleunced by self-esteem in personal relationship
- Based on the sociometer theory, it is hypothesized that women will be more affected by self-esteem in their ratings for relationship satisfaction 
- The study aim to explore the interaction between self-esteem and gender in predicting relationship satisfaciton

**Approach:**
- The data is collected from an open-source dataset from *PlosOne* by Wang (2015)
- A total of 104 Chinese college students were recruited, and they completed surveys assessing self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, power, and authenticity (i.e. how consistently one behave according to their true desires while interacting with others)

**Findings:**
- I tested how self-esteem and gender predicts relationship satisfaction by using multiple regression
- There is no gender differnece in how self-esteem predicts relationship satisfaction, which is agains the original hypothesis
- This shows that women are not more affected by self-esteem in personal reltionahips

- Interestingly, people generally see more colleagues and leaders who embody their core values than the ones who share their identity
- However, only those who identify as stigmatized report seeing less identity-based representation, whereas non-stigmatized people see equal levels of identity and values-based representation

### What Psychological Barriers Prevent LGB People from Coming Out?

- We used a national probability longitudinal dataset to explore the relationship between minority stressors (i.e., unique stressors experienced by sexual minorities) and coming out to a straight friend
- Suprisingly, the more everyday discrimination one experienced in the previous year, the more they likely they are going to come out in the next year
- This finding still holds after taking into account other minority stressors, demographics, perceived sexual orientation visibility, and disclosure history

### Does Ingroup Prejudice Hurt Asian Americans More?

- We examined how Asian Americans feel after experiencing ingroup prejudice (i.e., prejudice that comes from ingroup members)
- Results showed that Asian Americans who were rejected by Asian peers felt less positive towards Asians compared to their baseline attitudes, whereas experiencing prejudice from White peers did not change participantsâ€™ attitudes towards Whites
- Expectation and prejudice attribution are not related to this difference

### Do People Hold More Prejudice Towards Bisexual Singles?

- We asked people to rate single people with different sexual orientation backgrounds and found that people's assumptions about bisexual single people are more negative than gay/lesbian single people 
- This prejudice primarily comes from non-single people 
- The belief that bisexual people have more choices of potential dating partners partially explains the rating
