### How does the effect of self-esteem on relationship satisfaction differ between genders?
**Objectives:**
- The sociometer theory suggests that self-esteem not only reflects a person's perceived self-worth, but it also helps people to estimate their level of social acceptance in their relationships 
- Women are more sensitive to social acceptance cues, which makes them more easily influenced by self-esteem in personal relationships
- Based on the sociometer theory, I hypothesize that women will be more affected by self-esteem in their ratings for relationship satisfaction 
- The study aims to explore the interaction between self-esteem and gender in predicting relationship satisfaciton

**Approach:**
- The data is collected from an open-source dataset from *PlosOne* (Wang, 2015)
- A total of 104 Chinese college students were recruited, and they completed surveys assessing self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, power, and authenticity (i.e., how consistently one behaves according to their true desires while interacting with others)

**Findings:**
- I tested how self-esteem and gender predict relationship satisfaction by using multiple regression
- There is no gender difference in how self-esteem predicts relationship satisfaction, which contradicts the original hypothesis
- This shows that women are not more affected by self-esteem in personal reltionahips

- For exploratory purposes, I also tested the effect of self-esteem on relationship satsifaction when controlling for power and authenticity by using a multiple regression
- The results show that self-esteem can explain unique variances in the relationship satisfaction, showing that it is a strong predictor of relationship satisfaction

**Implications**
- The result contradicts the original hypothesis, which shows that gender does not affect self-esteem
- Since all the participants in this study are Chinese, this might suggest that the sociometer theory is less applicable in non-western samples
- This result calls for future research testing the sociometer theory in different cultural contexts and with bigger sample sizes
