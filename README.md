## Projects in Preparation
### Ingroup Prejudice

In this project, we examined how Asian Americans feel when experiencing ingroup prejudice (i.e., prejudice that comes from ingroup members). We found that Asian Americans who were prejudiced against by Asian peers felt significantly less positive towards Asians compared to their baseline attitudes, whereas experiencing prejudice from White peers did not change participants’ attitudes towards Whites.
